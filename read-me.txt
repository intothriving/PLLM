I created this by following the incredible YouTube video by Alejandro!  Thanks Alejandro!

It's really fascinating how this works.

You'll need to add an .env file containing the following:

OPENAI_API_KEY=[open ai key]
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=[hugging face token]
something="this"

It's very interesting how this works.  You basically upload your documents and click on the Process
button, then the program turns your documents into embeddings and stores them in a vector database then it 
does a similarity search based on the questions you ask about your documents.

It's brilliant.

I can think of all kind of cool things you could use this for and all kinds of enhancements, the 
possibilities are endless.

I can help you get it all set up if that isn't your thing too!
